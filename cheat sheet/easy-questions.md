## easy questions cheat sheet

This is a separate file, which will feature a master list of easy questions, used in the game contents.

### List of easy questions

Each question, will be categorized in four different categories. Which means, each time a new game starts, the questions are shuffled randomly.

These categories are:

  **Knowledge Questions:** Simple, mainly theoretical questions focusing on knowledge.
  
  **Completion Questions:** Mostly examples, based on simple or more complicated theory.

  **Calculation Questions:** Mostly examples, based on simple or more complicated theory.

  **Problems:** Examples using logic, applying basic or more complex mathematical operations, or encouraging thought to work more. 
  It's all in thought, in other words!
