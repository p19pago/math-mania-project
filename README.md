## Where can I find useful files for the game?

On the repository's main page, the `Files` folder includes all you need to have to run the game on your own machine.

Once you're located into the `Files` folder, the `final` subfolder features all necessary files as for the final version of the game.

## How to download files?

### Method 1: Download the Repository from 'Main' branch

The first page encountered is the `main` branch of the repository, where the `README.md` file is located.

Next to the `About` widget, on the left side, you'll see the `Code` button which looks like this.

Once you click on the button, the options look like this.

*(Local tab)*

Select `Download ZIP` to get a .ZIP file of the repository as a copy.

The downloaded ZIP file will show up on your `Downloads` folder on your machine.

Drag it to a desired directory `(usually on documents or on desktop)` or create your own directory.
Once done both ways, unzip or extract it, depending on your unzipping program.

**IMPORTANT: Consider extracting it on your downloads folder, once it's been extracted, the output shows a folder!!!**

### Method 2: Download all four files, individually

Once you're located on the `main` branch of the repository, you will see three subfolders.

![image](https://github.com/p19pago/math-mania-project/assets/72542408/f3c930da-0eb1-4443-90e7-9ba3b0a06d88)

Select the second out of total three subfolders, which goes for the `files` subfolder.

The content of the `files` subfolder looks like this.

![image](https://github.com/p19pago/math-mania-project/assets/72542408/470f5912-abd4-4194-82ad-e3ee6dd95598)

*(as time goes by, some changes will be made inside the folder, which does not impact the contents of it)*

Select the first out of total five files, or else the `final` subfolder.

This sub-folder holds all four files required for the game to run on your machine.

![image](https://github.com/p19pago/math-mania-project/assets/72542408/3c551ad3-ffb0-4ea1-84b4-ab019daa17a7)

The content of the `final` subfolder looks like this.

Open each file by hovering, then click on the file name.

For example, under the image below.

#### It is recommended each file be opened in a new tab.

(on the image above, the browser used is Google Chrome and language set to Greek)

Once each page has opened in a new tab, the file will be loaded.

Select the `Download` button.

The storing process is the same as the first method.

The downloaded files will show up on your `Downloads` folder on your machine.

Drag it to a desired directory `(usually on documents or on desktop)` or create your own directory.
Not all individual four files are extractable or part of a ZIP file.

On a directory, it is much easier to access the files rather than avoiding to store them.

**OPTIONAL: If you want, and use a text/code editor on your machine, consider editing the source code within the directory stored or an external directory on your machine,
so that once the HTML file is run, it will recognize the directory where the file(s) are stored.**

#### Since it is an HTML file, no directories are required to be used on source!!!

## Where can I find the instructions?

The instructions in both Greek and English are available on the `files` subfolder of the `main` branch.

Enjoy and good game!
